# Introduction

You're probably feeling like you need a bit of a JavaScript refresher 
before we get into the main part of the course.&nbsp; I'd like you to 
complete the lessons in the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
[Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/) 
tutorial. 
There are 113 lessons in that tutorial! However, they're all quite short, 
and each focuses on a specific aspect of JavaScript, with practice 
exercises. (If you find these below your level, you don't need to 
complete them, but this is our chance to get the whole class on the same 
page, so make sure you're comfortable with all of the material in the 
tutorial before next week!)

We'll actually be using FreeCodeCamp quite a lot this semester, as a sort 
of textbook. It does a really good job of presenting one idea at a time 
and providing good practice problems to try out. So it's not a bad idea 
to make an account, if you like (though an account is not required).

## Applied JavaScript
---
## Outline
* JavaScript Runtimes
* Secondary Learning Outcomes
---
## JavaScript Runtimes
* (browser)
* Node.js 
---
## (browser) Runtime 
* the JavaScript runtime is embeded in most modern browsers
* in addition to the core language there are APIs for:
	* the Document Object Model (DOM)
	* the Browser Object Model (BOM)
---
## Node.js Runtime
* most popular runtime for running JavaScript outside the browser 
* asynchronus, event-driven runtime 
* tuned for building scalable network application
* for example, web-based microservices 
* can handle multiple connections within a single thread 
---
## Secondary Learning Outcomes 
* automated testing (e.g. Jest)
* client-side frameworks (e.g. React)
* server-side frameworks (e.g. Express)
* deploying server-side applications (e.g. CloudRun)
* CI/CD 
---
## Automated Testing 
* every time we make a change to application we want to know that we didn't break anything
* we maintain a library of tests to run after every change 
* if any of the tests fail we have an opportunity to check
* there are frameworks for testing JavaScript applications (e.g. Jest)
---
## Client-side frameworks 
* the broser DOM is primitive and difficult to work with
* would like something higher-level for building most applications 
* there are a number of client-side frameworks available
* we will look at React (and Next.js)
---
## Browser-side frameworks 
* the Node.js network API is primitive and difficult to work with
* would like something higher-level for building most applications 
* there are a number of server-side frameworks available
* we will look at Express 
---
## Deploying Server-side Applications 
* for production applications we need somewhere to deploy the server-side code 
* virtual machines or containers in the cloud are a popular solution 
* we will look CloudRun which is a container solution running on Google's Cloud Platform 
---
## CI/CD 
* Continuous Integration (CI) - the applicaton is rebuilt and tested automatically after every change 
* Continuous Delivery/Deployment - if the automated tests pass, the newly built applicaiton is automatically deployed
